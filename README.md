# Project Overview:
The "Attic Robot" is a remote-controlled car designed to assist homeowners, inspectors, and pest control professionals in safely and efficiently inspecting hard-to-reach attic spaces. Traditional methods of attic inspection often involve physically entering cramped, dark, and potentially hazardous areas, making the process time-consuming and risky. This project offers a safer and more practical alternative by enabling remote inspections through a compact, camera-equipped car that can navigate attic spaces while providing real-time video feeds.

The project incorporates various sensors, including a humidity and temperature sensor and a camera mounted on a servo motor, to detect mold, insect activity, and environmental conditions. The car is controlled using a PC by connecting to a specific network, with arrows controlling the movements. The live camera feed, accessible via a websocket, allows the user to check real-time situations in the attic.

This product targets adults who value technology-driven solutions for home improvement and inspection tasks. By integrating user-friendly controls and many other features, the car simplifies attic inspections for a wide range of users, regardless of technical expertise.
