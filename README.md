1.1 Project Overview:
The proposed project involves the development of a remote-controlled car designed specifically for inspecting attics. This innovative vehicle is equipped with an array of sensors and features that enable it to detect environmental conditions, focusing on humidity, mold presence, and insects. At the core of the project is a compact and maneuverable chassis that can navigate the confined spaces of an attic, allowing for efficient inspections without the need for human entry. A humidity sensor will measure moisture levels in the attic environment and providing crucial data for assessing the potential for mold growth.

Furthermore, a camera mounted on the car will provide real-time video feeds, enabling users to visually inspect the attic remotely. The camera will be placed on a servo motor for tilting up and down, ensuring a comprehensive view of the attic space and a small light to allow the user to see more clearly. 

Overall, this project aims to offer a practical solution for homeowners, inspectors, and pest control professionals by providing an automated, efficient, and thorough method for monitoring attic conditions.

1.2 Purpose and Scope of this Specification:
The primary purpose of this project is to create an efficient and automated solution for inspecting attics, focusing on the detection of moisture, mold, and insect activity. By developing a remote-controlled car equipped with advanced sensors, the project aims to enhance safety by minimizing the need for individuals to physically enter potentially hazardous attic spaces, which may contain mold, pests, or structural issues.

Additionally, it seeks to improve monitoring by providing a proactive approach to home maintenance, enabling early detection of moisture problems and infestations, thus preventing costly damage and health hazards. The project also aims to facilitate easy inspection, allowing homeowners, inspectors, and pest control professionals to conduct thorough inspections remotely, saving time and effort.

The scope of this project encompasses several key components and functionalities. First, it involves the design and development of a compact, maneuverable remote-controlled car capable of navigating tight attic spaces while integrating various sensors, including humidity, mold, and insect sensors to monitor attic conditions.
